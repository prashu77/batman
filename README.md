> You will be prompted for **three** configuration parameters. See the [Bot Registration Guide][REL1] and the [LUIS Programmatic-Key Guide][REL3] if you need help finding these values.
```PowerShell
$rg = "call-center"
$loc = "eastus"
New-AzureRmResourceGroup $rg $loc
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name CallCenterSolution -ResourceGroupName $rg -TemplateFile .\azuredeploy.json
```

# Usage
You will use the [Skype Client][20] to initiate calls to your bot (*Skype for Business is not current supported*).

> **Windows Users** may use the [App Store Client][21]

Before talking to your bot, you must add it to your Skype contacts list. You can find a link to add your bot to Skype on the [Bot Portal][2] under the channel listing.

> Directly add the bot to your contacts: https://join.skype.com/bot/YOUR_APP_ID

Using your Skype client, initiate a call to your bot and follow the prompts. You can order any product in the standard adventure works category, such as a mountain bike, fenders, or bike wash. The bot will prompt you to disambiguate product names or to choose product attributes, if necessary.

## Sample product queries
1. "*mountain bike*": a general product category
1. "*what is mountain 500?*": get more information about a specific product
1. "*mountain 500*": a specific product
1. "*mountain 500 in silver*": a specific product with a specific color
1. "*bicycle for road use*": a natural language query
1. "*extra large jersey*": a general product category with specific size

# Scaling
A basic deployment will scale to around 10 concurrent requests per second. Each layer of the architecture supports a separate level of concurrency, but the entire solution is bound by the narrowest pipeline of all the services. Services may be scaled **up** to support higher throughput per resource, or scaled **out** to spread throughput across multiple resources.

| SERVICE | MAX RPS PER INSTANCE | SCALE UP | SCALE OUT |
| ------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- |
| LUIS | 10 | N/A | Custom account partitioning |
| Bing Speech | 20 | N/A | Custom account partitioning |
| App Service | 100s | Add RAM/cores | Add instances |
| Search | ~60 | N/A | Add replicas |
| Cosmos DB (DocumentDB) | ~10K | N/A | Add partitioning |
| Blobs | ~20K | N/A | N/A |

> **CUSTOM ACCOUNT PARTITIONING**: Scale-out of Bing Speech and LUIS is not currently available. If your scaling needs exceed 10 requests per second, you can implement a custom load balancing scheme across multiple service endpoints.
>
> E.g. to double the capacity of LUIS, create a second LUIS application using the same JSON configuration as the first. Then modify your bot to perform round-robin (alternating) queries to each service.

# Customization
This bot is tuned end-to-end to work specifically with the AdventureWorks sample product database. In order to transition to a custom data set, some consideration must be taken to account for the format and structure of your custom data and how to apply best practices for LUIS and Azure Search.

## Identify your intents (LUIS)
Intents drive the workflow of your bot. If a caller is prompted to speak a product query, but responds with a desire to get the shipping status on an existing order, the bot should seamlessly branch to a new dialog to fulfill the new request, and then return to the original prompt.

There are two primary challenges when working with open-ended, natural conversation dialogs:
1. It is impractical to provide coverage for every conceivable intent. A bot is an intelligent conversationalist, not true Artificial Intelligence.
1. User-discovery of the intent-recognition scenarios that the bot *does* support can be difficult to facilitate without rote narration of available options.

To overcome these challenges, it is often best to begin with a directed, default intent. Try to guide the conversation as much as possible with yes-or-no questions or short, multiple choice options.

However, the service should allow the caller to go off-script when the caller's spoken intent does not match the prompt. The Bot Framework manages a dialog stack for you, so your bot can easily fork to a new set of prompts and responses before returning to the original, directed, dialog. Your custom intents should be domain-specific, but still generic actions. 

An intent describes the **action** and the **domain** of some user request. A domain represents a high level grouping of some logical section of your app (e.g. products, orders, calendar). The action is some verb that describes what to do against that domain (typically a variant of the typical database CRUD actions–Create, Read, Update, Delete). An intent returned from LUIS may include entities, which, in terms of natural language, can be thought of as the objects to a transitive verb. An entity is the "on what" or "against what" component of the intent's action.

> Learn how to [add entities to your LUIS app][27] in the LUIS portal.
> 
> Learn how to automatically [map your LUIS intents to Bot Dialogs][28] in code.

## Identify your entities (LUIS)
Every domain has its own set of common entities. An entity represents a class of similar objects that are detected from raw text by LUIS. There are three main types of entities: **prebuilt** (cross-domain, provided by Bing), **custom** (learned from your labeled data), and **closed-list** (a static set of terms chosen by you). This app uses only closed-list entities across four classes: `color`, `category`, `sex`, and `size`.

Your goal when building and training custom entities should be to identify object classes that can be used by the search engine to boost results for the specified class.

## Using entities with search (LUIS & Azure Search)
There are two approaches to using entities with search: `filtering` and `boosting`. By applying a filter, you eliminate results that do not match the entity metadata. By applying a boost, you surface matching entities to the top of the result set, but you also return non-matches, albeit with a lower score. 

### Entity Filters
Use a `filter` when the entity represents a broad or unambiguous category or if the utterance is comprised *soley* of entities. E.g.:
```
"bicycle"     // "bicycle is a category entity
"clothing"    // "clothing" is a category entity
"red bicycle" // "red" is a color entity; "bicycle" is a category entity
```

Apply a search filter to return only matches for `red bicycle` where the color field is `red`:
```
<url>?search=red bicycle&$filter=colors/any(x: x eq 'red')
```

### Entity Boosts
Use a `boost` when the entity is included with other terms. E.g.:
```
"mountain bicycle" // a category->bicycle filter would be ok here
"bicycle rack"     // but not here. "bicycle racks" are in the 'accessories' category; not the 'bicycles' category
```

Apply a search boost to raise the score for the same results from the filtered query (typically bringing matches to the top of the result set) *while still including other colors as well* (e.g. if `red` was not available):
```
<url>?red bicycle colors:red^2
```

## Identify common synonyms (Azure Search)
Use custom analyzers in Azure Search to enable content matching against domain-specific synonyms, or to map between a product's written form and its spoken form. For instance, product sizes are represented in the database as `S`, `M`, `L`, and `XL`, however, when speaking, we refer to `small`, `medium`, `large`, and `extra large`. Use one or more `#Microsoft.Azure.Search.SynonymTokenFilter`s to enable matching between these different forms.

> Learn more about [creating custom analyzers in Azure Search][23]

This app uses three synonym groups to map both between language variants (hat/cap) and representational variants (S/small):

### Size
```JSON
[
  "S,small",
  "M,medium",
  "XL,extra large",
  "L,large"
]
```

### Product
```JSON
[
  "bike=>bicycle",
  "lady,girl=>woman",
  "guy,boy=>man",
  "clothes=>clothing",
  "hat=>cap"
]
```

### Sex
```JSON
[
  "lady,girl=>woman",
  "guy,boy=>man"
]
```

> Azure Search now supports [query-time synonym maps in public preview][24].

## Data Wrangling (SQL Server)
Source content (SQL tables, raw files, etc.) often is not in an ideal state for consumption by bots and search applications.
This section describes common preprocessing transformations that can be applied to source content. In this case, the source content is an Azure SQL database containing a handful of tables describing a product catalog.

### Connect to a Table or a View?
Azure Search offers a configurable `Azure SQL indexer` for no-code, automated ingest of your source content, given the name of a `table` or `view` in your database. For simple data sets, a `table` works well, but for most applications, you will want to connect to a custom `view` to account for SQL joins, predicates, and other custom result processing.
> Learn more about connecting [Azure Search and Azure SQL][25]

### Defining a search "document"
Search documents, by nature, are denormalized (unjoined). Azure Search does not support joins, so all of the information describing a result must be attached to a single document. 

To achieve a high level of performance and usability, it is critical to apply a proper denormalization strategy against your normalized (table-joined) data. A common mistake is to simply map each row of a single table to a corresponding search document. For data structures like a product catalog that are highly normalized, this can often lead to "noisy" data, or the reverse effect, information loss.

Consider the following two AdventureWorks tables. Both contain product names, but the latter has many repeated sections, varying only by a single attribute.

#### SalesLT.ProductModel
| Name |
| ---- |
| HL Road Frame |
| LL Road Frame |
| ML Road Frame |
| ML Road Frame-W |

#### SalesLT.Product
| Name |
| ---- |
| HL Road Frame - Black, 44 |
| HL Road Frame - Black, 48 |
| HL Road Frame - Black, 52 |
| HL Road Frame - Black, 58 |
| HL Road Frame - Black, 62 |
| HL Road Frame - Red, 44 |
| HL Road Frame - Red, 48 |
| HL Road Frame - Red, 52 |
| HL Road Frame - Red, 56 |
| HL Road Frame - Red, 58 |
| HL Road Frame - Red, 62 |
| ... and so on, for LL, ML, and ML-W, etc. |

If we envision each row as a search result, the second table is quickly overwhelmed with near-duplicate results, leading to a poor user experience. However, the first table lacks valuable product information needed to identify a specific product SKU.

The solution is to **collapse** the information from the second table onto the first using a custom `view` and a handful of `user-defined functions`.

> Other ETL techniques may be used to massage your content. This example uses functions.
>
> See the [custom view][REL4] used by this solution.

Azure Search supports the `Collection(Edm.String)` document type for storing semi-complex, searchable metadata on a document. In this case, we will define two collections: one for `color` and one for `size`. Both of these product attributes should be searchable, but, because they are attached to a parent document, they will not return a new document for every possible combination. The ideal search document looks like:

```JSON
{
  "productModelId": "26",
  "modifiedDate": "2006-06-01T00:00:00Z",
  "name": "Road-250",
  "category": ["bikes", "road bikes"],
  "colors": ["black", "red"],
  "sizes": ["44", "48", "52", "58"],
  "sex": "Unisex",
  "maxStandardCost": 1554.9479,
  "minStandardCost": 1518.7864,
  "maxListPrice": 2443.35,
  "minListPrice": 2443.35,
  "products": "<serialized-json-here>",
  "description_HE": "<hebrew-text-here>",
  "description_ZH_CHT": "<chinese-text-here>",
  "description_EN": "<english-text-here>",
  "description_AR": "<arabic-text-here>",
  "description_TH": "<thai-text-here>",
  "description_FR": "<french-text-here>"
}
```

In order to properly prepare the values for Azure Search, we must coerce them into a JSON string. As of this writing, there is no built-in SQL functionality to achieve this, but we can apply the SQL `coalesce` operator inside a custom function to build the string:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION ufnGetColorsJson(@productModelId int)
RETURNS nvarchar(max)
AS 
BEGIN
  DECLARE @vals AS nvarchar(max)
  SELECT
    @vals = coalesce(@vals + ',"', '"') + [t].[color] + '"'
  FROM
    (
      SELECT
        DISTINCT [color]
      FROM
        [SalesLt].[Product] [p]
      WHERE
        [p].[productModelId]=@productModelId
    ) [t]
  RETURN lower('[' + @vals + ']')
END
```

Then we create a new `view` to return the denormalized representation of our data:
```sql
CREATE VIEW [SalesLT].[vProductsForSearch]
AS
SELECT
  [pm].[name],
  [pm].[productModelId],
  [pm].[modifiedDate],
  (SELECT dbo.ufnGetColorsJson([productModelId])) [colors],
  (SELECT dbo.ufnGetSizesJson([productModelId])) [sizes]
FROM
  [SalesLt].[ProductModel] [pm]
```

> See the full view with more custom functions in this repo under `./data/sql`

Azure Search executes this view when it indexes (and periodically re-indexes) the product database.
